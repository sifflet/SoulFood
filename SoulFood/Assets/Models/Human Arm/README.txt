Human skeleton, right arm, high poly model
******************************************

* anatomically correct 
(inasmuch as the original data are correct - see caveats at http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/info/index.html)

* high poly, at least in the original .blend file. Other formats provided are exports from Blender,
and seem to have lost some accuracy

* parts are tagged with their FMA-number and correct anatomical names
(at least in the .blend file, I've noticed that .3DS truncates the names)

* parts_list.png gives an overview of the FMA-numbers and the anatomical names,
so you won't get lost

* model is NOT rigged, all parts are loose, with their origin at their centre of mass

* parts were downloaded from the <BodyParts3D> project database and are provided "as is", 
I've just scaled them to match an average human body size.
